    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;From big to accurate tech: my self-hosted setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mission&quot;&gt;The mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing big tech platforms with self-hosted solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;google drive and calendar -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://nextcloud.com/&quot;&gt;nextcloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;google photos -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://immich.app/&quot;&gt;immich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spotify -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.navidrome.org/&quot;&gt;navidrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/&quot;&gt;codeberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gmail -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailbox.org/en/&quot;&gt;mailbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hacker news -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freshrss.org/&quot;&gt;freshrss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tailscale -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://headscale.net/stable/&quot;&gt;headscale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(bonus track) scattered note taking -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://silverbullet.md/&quot;&gt;silverbullet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built the system myself but you can get there in an afternoon with &lt;a href=&quot;https://yunohost.org/&quot;&gt;yunohost&lt;/a&gt;. It provides a way to self-host a huge amount of apps through a unified interface. I chose not to use it as I wanted to experiment and learn myself how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this lives on a Hetzner&#39;s CX33 (~ 6.50 euro/month) with a 100GB SSD volume (~3.50 euro/month) and is fully open-source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided not to selfhost emails as it is quite tricky not to get your emails flagged as spam. What I did instead was subscribe to a standard plan at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailbox.org/en/&quot;&gt;mailbox.org&lt;/a&gt; and use this websites’s domain as a custom domain for my email (~ 3 euro/month).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dpaletti.com/posts/self_hosting/#the-conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nextcloud&lt;/strong&gt;: does not need many introductions, a self-hosted cloud service with far more features you will ever use. Used in production by individuals and companies alike. I use it for the sheer simplicity of installing it through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one&quot;&gt;all in one container&lt;/a&gt;. I do not have many requirements for a service like this, I use it for &lt;strong&gt;document and calendary syncing across devices&lt;/strong&gt;. All other features I don’t mind but there’s a ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immich&lt;/strong&gt;: the de-facto standard in open-source image archiving. Actively predates google photos by providing intelligent search and (local) machine-learning features. Clean UX both for the browser and the mobile versions. Provides features to transfer all your library from the most popular services and to batch process your images from the CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navidrome&lt;/strong&gt;: Spotify is unbearable, it got so much worse that I could not justify paying for it. I won’t even start on just artist retribution and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deedsmag.com/stories/what-spotifys-latest-controversy-reveals&quot;&gt;AI-weapons support&lt;/a&gt;.
Navidrome is not perfect but it works. It is an old-school program, it does just one thing, the music server. This means it does not embed any music player whatsoever, you will need dedicated clients for streaming your music library. I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CappielloAntonio/tempo&quot;&gt;Tempo&lt;/a&gt; for mobile and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic&quot;&gt;Supersonic&lt;/a&gt; for desktop, both quite simple apps that just work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symfonium.app/&quot;&gt;Symphonium&lt;/a&gt; is pretty widely used but it&#39;s closed source, which is a nono.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Codeberg + self-hosted Forgejo actions&lt;/strong&gt;: I won’t get in too much detail here as I will publish a more in-depth article on Git forges and git alternatives in a bit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/&quot;&gt;Codeberg&lt;/a&gt; is a fully-fledged github alternative that under the hood uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://forgejo.org/&quot;&gt;ForgeJo&lt;/a&gt;  as a git forge. Think of a git forge as a git server with added features such as pull-requests, project management, wikis, static website serving, and all the other services you expect from Github, Gitlab, Gitea and the likes. I am a firm believer in the publish once syndicate everywhere strategy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;) so I will be still mirroring to github most of my repos but the core of my work will be developed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/dpaletti/&quot;&gt;my codeberg account&lt;/a&gt;. That said, as of now I am not hosting my forgejo instance but I am hosting my own forgejo runners (github job runners equivalent) so that I do not have CI limitations and still get to support Codeberg which is a really nice initiative (more on this in the next article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshrss&lt;/strong&gt;: RSS is one of the most underrate internet technologies. Several websites provide RSS feeds, that is a daily/weekly update on new content you can aggregate all in one app. That app is FreshRSS, a RSS feed aggregator that just works. Clean UI (that’s an acquired taste I fear) and very high quality clients, I am using &lt;a href=&quot;https://capyreader.com/&quot;&gt;Capy Reader&lt;/a&gt; and the FreshRSS web interface from desktop. Supports categories, feeds and many RSS variations. Definitely the best way to stay updated across multiple blogs, newspapers and news aggregators (still reading Hacker News, not proud of it though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silverbullet&lt;/strong&gt;: one of the services I use most. &lt;a href=&quot;https://silverbullet.md/&quot;&gt;Silverbullet&lt;/a&gt; is a note-taking browser based application with progressive web apps for all platforms that actually work. I use it mainly from my laptop but I do minor edits from my mobile, works seamlessly. Great level of UX polish, astounding number of features, Lua extensibility and distraction-free editing experience. Offline-first app with great syncing strategies and conflict resolution, the absence of adhoc apps greatly simplifies the design and allows for a very coherent experience across devices and operating systems. This is the first time that I think a progressive web app (PWA) is the right tools for the job. I have completely stopped using &lt;a href=&quot;https://orgmode.org/&quot;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; and the first time I actually feel I have the note taking app I want in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caddy&lt;/strong&gt;: from the same VPS I am also serving this website. This is thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://caddyserver.com/&quot;&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt; which is a reverse-proxy that also handles certificate renewal so that this website and all other services are accessible through HTTPS. A reverse-proxy is just a way to have a unique entrypoint and to all my services (we will see later how this is actually achieved) and then have my requests redirected to the correct service. Caddy is a tool that just works, there are many others, this works for me and I did not need to look much further but there are many alternatives. For me, automatic certificate management and renewal was enough. All in all, Caddy is a nice solution if you want to ditch Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headscale&lt;/strong&gt;: self-hosted tailscale. Tailscale is a mesh VPN but the coordination server it uses is not open-source, while the client is. The idea is to have a central door to which device must be registered otherwise they get rejectd. This way we can handle authentication seamlessly. That central door is the authentication server, and headscale is an open-source implementation of it. The headscale repo is still basically in the hands of the tailscale organization but this is the best I could do. I do not have many more ideas to easily manage device authentication. You will also need some clients and for that I am using the official tailscale clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beszel&lt;/strong&gt;: I needed something to monitor resource utilization and the state of all the services, Beszel perfectly fits this need. Incredibly easy to install and with a very polished web UI provides: resource utilization, service state, and log for all services. I evaluated a combo of graphana and prometheus but I did not want an overly complicated solution for my very limited needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-execution&quot;&gt;Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on I will talk about the deployment you can find in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/dpaletti/self-hosted-services&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full deployment needs 3 files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yaml&lt;/code&gt;: contains all services as docker containers and inlined configuration files for both Caddy and Headscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;firewalld_config.sh&lt;/code&gt;: a firewall(d) configuration script to block all traffic except what’s strictly necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;: secrets and environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many self-hostable services have docker-compose files ready to go you can simply add to your global configuration. Networking and security are a bit less straightforward but all in all is nothing esoteric. This is the high-level system diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dpaletti.com/assets/posts/self_hosted_diagram.webp&quot; alt=&quot;VPS architecture&quot; width=&quot;90%,&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a request arrives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;firewall blocks everything that is not HTTP(S) or SSH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;caddy acts as a reverse proxy managing HTTPS, rate limiting and hiding network topology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then the request is filtered by headscale that checks whether the device sending the request is allowed to access the service is asking for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if everything went well the service is accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of configuration allows for seamless access for authorized devices while keeping the server reasonably secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now take a more in-depth look at some of the services that make this flow possible. I kept everything inside the single compose file to avoid scattering and ease both long maintenance and AI chatbot interaction (I need to copy paste the whole file and I am done). Yes, it’s no agentic AI setup but one of the main reason I developed this is to understand the ins and outs of the solution. On top of this, I did not want to lose control over the design, longterm maintenance cost is paramount and AI usually trades this off with shorterm sub-optimal working solutions that accrue a lot of technical debt over time. This is to say, I used AI sparingly to build this, mainly to round some corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;caddy-setup&quot;&gt;Caddy setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caddy is the reverse-proxy that handles all traffic to the server, including the traffic to this website. There is an official image that I extended with a plugin for rate limiting access to this blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;caddy:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile_inline: |
      &lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; caddy:builder &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; builder&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;RUN&lt;/span&gt; xcaddy build &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&#92;&lt;/span&gt;
          --with github.com/mholt/caddy-ratelimit&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; caddy:latest&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;COPY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token options&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;--from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy&lt;/span&gt;
  container_name: caddy
  restart: always
  volumes:
    - caddy_certs:/certs
    - caddy_config:/config
    - caddy_data:/data
    - caddy_sites:/srv
    - /root/blog:/blog
  network_mode: &quot;host&quot;
  configs:
  - source: Caddyfile
    target: /etc/caddy/Caddyfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea here is using inline dockerfile to keep everything in one file as much as possible. So much that also the Caddy config file is inside the same docker-compose file. In this section and all the subsequent ones I will pick only the most relevant bits of the docker-compose file which is quite long (and boring) to be fully discussed in this article. Again, you find the full file in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/dpaletti/self-hosted-services&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, to actually serve the blog and rate limit it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;configs:
  Caddyfile:
    content: |
  (rate_limit_blog) {
      rate_limit {
          zone blog {
              key {remote_ip}
              events 500
              window 1s
              burst 100
          }
      }
  }

  $DOMAIN {

      import rate_limit_blog
      root * /blog

      encode zstd gzip

      header {
          Strict-Transport-Security &quot;max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains&quot;
          X-XSS-Protection &quot;1; mode=block&quot;
          X-Frame-Options &quot;DENY&quot;
          Content-Security-Policy &quot;default-src &#39;self&#39;; style-src &#39;self&#39; &#39;unsafe-inline&#39;; script-src &#39;self&#39;&quot;
      }

      file_server
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other service you want to add which you want to serve just needs basic reverse-proxy configuration. In my case, I decided to use this domain as the basis of all my networking configuration so for instance I wanted to access FreshRSS at &lt;code&gt;rss.dpaletti.com&lt;/code&gt;. This means, that you need to setup DNS records at your domain registrar (I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://porkbun.com/&quot;&gt;porkbun&lt;/a&gt; and it works quite well) and then add to the caddy configuration something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;rss.$DOMAIN {
           reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8081
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above we assume that the FreshRSS service container is defined along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;  freshrss:
    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
    container_name: freshrss
    hostname: freshrss
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      options:
        max-size: 10m
    volumes:
      - rss_data:/var/www/FreshRSS/data
      - rss_extensions:/var/www/FreshRSS/extensions
    ports:
      - &quot;127.0.0.1:8081:80&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the original port 80 gets mapped to 8081 so avoiding clash with other services which may use port 80 by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have a working reverse proxy configuration but anyone can access &lt;code&gt;rss.dpaletti.com&lt;/code&gt;. In general, we assume a login page at that point but I would prefer to keep these services private given that I am also archiving personal photos and notes. To do this, we deploy headscale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;headscale-setup&quot;&gt;Headscale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main objective here is having a way to securely connect to my services by recording which devices are allowed access to the services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;headscale:
    image: headscale/headscale:latest
    container_name: headscale
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: serve
    configs:
      - source: headscale_config
        target: /etc/headscale/config.yaml
    volumes:
      &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Use a named volume for the database and keys&lt;/span&gt;
      - headscale_data:/var/lib/headscale
      - headscale_run:/var/run/headscale
    dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 1.1.1.1
    ports:
      - &quot;127.0.0.1:8085:8080&quot;
      - &quot;127.0.0.1:9090:9090&quot;
      - &quot;3478:3478/udp&quot;
    healthcheck:
      test: [&quot;CMD&quot;, &quot;headscale&quot;, &quot;health&quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is headscale docker-compose configuration, almost everything copy pasted from the docs with slight adaptations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configs: I decided I wanted to inline headscale config so to have everything in one file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lables and networks: this is beszle specific config so that we can monitor resource utilization (you will find this attached to all services)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;port mapping: avoid clash with other services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we want to route traffic from caddy through tailscale. To accomplish this we need to slightly extend the caddy config file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;(private) {
          @denied not remote_ip 100.64.0.0/10 fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48 127.0.0.1 ::1 2a01:4f8:1c1a:5a7b::1
          respond @denied &quot;Access Denied: You are not on the private network.&quot; 403
      }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rule checks whether the device is succesfully logged into tailscale, if not it gets bounced. Last step is enforcing this rule for all traffic we want to filter, our FreshRSS rule becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;rss.$DOMAIN {
         import private
         reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8081
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we need the tailscale log-in flow to work. To accomplish that we expose the headscale coordination server through Caddy and we configure it appropriately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt; headscale.$DOMAIN {
   handle /web* {
       import private
       reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8086
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is the headscale-config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;      server_url: https://headscale.dpaletti.com:443
      [... defaults skipped, find the whole config in the repo ...]

&lt;p&gt;The most important section is noting that for every service I want to expose I need to update magic DNS so that headscale correctly redirects to the requested service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows to expose services on subdomains of the domain hosting my blog while keeping access only to desired devices without recurring to Tailscale’s closed source coordination server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;firewalld&quot;&gt;Firewalld&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://firewalld.org/&quot;&gt;Firewalld&lt;/a&gt; is truely great and easy to use. The main idea is that changes can be done immediately in the runtime environment without service restart. I am not an expert on this, so I got a very barebones configuration practically blacklisting all connections and keeping only the ones I needed. On top of that, I enabled masquerading (network address translation) to allow FreshRSS to download the feeds. This is all my configuration which I keep in a &lt;code&gt;.sh&lt;/code&gt; file which I can easily run to apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;==&gt; Enabling firewalld&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
systemctl &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--now&lt;/span&gt; firewalld

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;==&gt; Reload (clean slate)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--reload&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;==&gt; Setting default zone to public&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
firewall-cmd --set-default-zone&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;public

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;==&gt; Enabling Masquerading (Required for container outbound traffic)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--permanent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;public --add-masquerade

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;==&gt; Explicitly allowing essential public services&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--permanent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;public --add-service&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;ssh
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--permanent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;public --add-service&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;http
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--permanent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;public --add-service&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;https
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--permanent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;public --add-port&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3478&lt;/span&gt;/udp

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;==&gt; Reloading firewall rules&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
firewall-cmd &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--reload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is setting the default zone to public so that all connections are blocked by default. Then, add essential connections to the public zone to allow them. Very simple setup, again, I am not good at this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;deployment&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying all this is done through a Forgejo action from my repo. Forgejo actions are Github action compatible so it is pretty straightforward to write one, you can find the full implementation &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/dpaletti/self-hosted-services/src/branch/main/.forgejo/workflows/deploy.yaml&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
First we checkout the repo and retrieve secrets (much like github) and paste them in the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Checkout repository
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//github.com/actions/checkout@v6

      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Update .env file with secrets
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token scalar string&quot;&gt;
          sed -i &quot;s|SILVERBULLET_USER=.*|SILVERBULLET_USER=$|g&quot; synced/.env
          sed -i &quot;s|SILVERBULLET_PSW=.*|SILVERBULLET_PSW=$|g&quot; synced/.env
          sed -i &quot;s|BESZEL_TOKEN=.*|BESZEL_TOKEN=$|g&quot; synced/.env
          sed -i &quot;s|BESZEL_KEY=.*|BESZEL_KEY=$|g&quot; synced/.env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we sync everything to the VPS through &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt;, this is a good example of using a github action inside a forgejo action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Sync to VPS
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//github.com/burnett01/rsync&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;deployments@v8
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;switches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;avzr
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; synced/
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;remote_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;remote_host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;remote_port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;remote_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;remote_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we apply firewall and docker config using SSH keys we are keeping as secrets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Execute deployment commands
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; https&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;//github.com/appleboy/ssh&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;action@v1
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;port&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $
          &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token scalar string&quot;&gt;
            chmod +x firewalld_config.sh
            ./firewalld_config.sh
            docker compose up -d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been quite a ride. This setup has been working for several months without additional tweaking. Removing platforms from my life has been really beneficial. Far lowered general internet usage, got back to discovering music and movies from long-form blogs instead of doom scrolling algorithms. Along these lines, I have also opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.coop/@dpaletti&quot;&gt;Mastodon profile&lt;/a&gt; which helps me discovering interesting people and discussions, I have been using it with Phanpy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://yunohost.org/&quot;&gt;Yunohost&lt;/a&gt; can be a really good tradeoff between effort and independence leaving the most with no excuses to keep using enshittified, expensive, privacy violating services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Making sense of entropies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s a working definition of entropy we can use across multiple contexts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity stems from the vast number of definitions given formally and informally through time. We will start with the first definition and work our way through some of the more modern ones to get a sense of what we mean and what we definitely should not mean when talking about entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it, the first definition from thermodynamics (wanted to fit all in one equation, so I also added the Clausius inequality). Given some amount of heat &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;delta Q&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03785em;&quot;&gt;δ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leaving the environment sitting at &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mtext&gt;env&lt;/mtext&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;T_&#92;text{env}&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.13889em;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.1514em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.1389em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord text mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mtight&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and absorbed by a system, the cyclic integral must be less than or equal to 0. Now the question becomes, what’s a cyclic integral? The intuition is fairly simple: when equality holds, it means that the quantity &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mfrac&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;Q&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mfrac&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;frac{&#92;delta Q}{T}&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:1.2772em;vertical-align:-0.345em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mopen nulldelimiter&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mfrac&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.9322em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.655em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.13889em;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-3.23em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;frac-line&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom-width:0.04em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-3.4461em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:3em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03785em;&quot;&gt;δ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.345em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mclose nulldelimiter&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; absorbed by the system is equally compensated by the amount emitted from the environment. Also, if equality holds, I am moving all the heat (energy as heat) from the environment to the system without losing anything and creating a so-called reversible transformation. We call it reversible because &lt;strong&gt;this integral is telling me that I can go back and forth exchanging heat all I want, and I won’t ever lose anything. This is, of course, impossible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real transformations are irreversible, and this is what that inequality is saying. When you are moving heat from the environment to a system, trying to move it back, you will find yourself with less heat between your hands. This means that &lt;strong&gt;entropy quantifies the non-idealities of a transformation&lt;/strong&gt; by describing how much heat I waste when moving it from one source to a destination due to real-world dissipation and friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyclic integral has another important implication: &lt;strong&gt;entropy in reversible processes is a state function&lt;/strong&gt;. When we can show that a quantity does not change through a cyclic integral (equality holds), this means that taken two points &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;A&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;B&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05017em;&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; entropy can be quantified by looking only at the origin and destination state without taking into account the path from one to the other. This is important because &lt;strong&gt;entropy can be used to qualify transformations from a higher level of abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;, disregarding how the transformation happened. On top of this, entropy can be easily computed for non-cyclic processes. Take a real transformation from &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;A&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;B&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05017em;&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; once we get to &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;B&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05017em;&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we have an irreversible transformation, but we also know that the entropy of a reversible transformation is 0. So, to compute the entropy of the real transformation from &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;A&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;B&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05017em;&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it is sufficient to connect &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;B&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;B&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05017em;&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;A&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;A&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a reversible transformation which won’t affect our computation of the real entropy of the process. This way, we characterize the entropy of a transformation and not necessarily a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization that for every transformation we have an increase in entropy due to some non-idealities that lose some energy is very clear in &lt;strong&gt;Planck’s statement of the second law of thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every process occurring in nature proceeds in the sense in which the sum of the entropies of all bodies taking part in the process is increased. In the limit, i.e. for reversible processes, the sum of the entropies remains unchanged.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a complete equilibrium that guarantees fixed entropy; every time something changes I lose some energy in the process. This kind of statement may start to clarify why there exists &lt;strong&gt;a link between entropy and time&lt;/strong&gt;. I know only a quantity that is guaranteed not to decrease with time; time itself. However, we have just established that entropy is another of such quantities, so we can say that both travel in the same direction, entropy points (like an arrow) in the same direction of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, &lt;strong&gt;entropy is neither disorder nor any other exotic concept (for now)&lt;/strong&gt;. In classical thermodynamics, entropy is “only” a way to quantify the amount of energy (as heat) we lose when we move it somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? Where did the logarithm come from? Where did the integral go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a step back. Why did Boltzmann want a new definition of entropy in the first place? Wasn’t the one from before enough? No, it was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classical thermodynamics looks at macroscopic quantities while Boltzmann wanted to look at the microscopic&lt;/strong&gt;. Boltzmann was interested in the microscopic explanation of temperature, pressure, volume, and entropy. Statistical mechanics was born with the sole purpose of explaining everything that thermodynamics did, but starting from particles. Boltzmann set out to show that the second law of thermodynamics is a consequence of the collision between the particles of a gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a gas made of identical particles (a strong assumption, but bear with me), the state of such a gas can be fully specified by each particle’s position and momentum (product of mass and velocity), also called its microstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;coarse-graining&lt;/strong&gt; enters the stage. If you think of the microstate visually, you can superimpose a grid on it. That is, if the microstate were for a second comprised only of particles’ positions, you could put a grid on it and count how many particles are in each square of the grid. Take a look at the image below. We have a box of particles; their position in the box is the microstate. We decide that we are interested in which particles are to the right and to the left of the middle of the box; this is our macrostate. The particles are all equal, so we are only interested in counting how many are on each side. The macrostate with 4 particles on one side and 4 particles on the other can be realized in several ways, depending on which particle is on which side. This would not change the macrostate we are in, but would change the microstate, that is, which specific particle is on which side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dpaletti.com/assets/posts/micro_macro-modified.png&quot; alt=&quot;micro vs macro state&quot; width=&quot;90%,&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the &lt;strong&gt;macrostate is a rough approximation of the microstate&lt;/strong&gt;. Temperature, volume, and in general macroscopic properties do not care (in this simplified equal particles assumption) which particle is in which square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can finally define &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;W&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;W&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.13889em;&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the argument of the logarithm. First, we describe the state of the gas through the distribution of particles, the count for each square of the number of particles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where Boltzmann left off and Planck kept going. Boltzmann, throughout his career focused on &lt;strong&gt;bridging thermodynamics and probability theory&lt;/strong&gt; because, as he states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the molecules of the body are indeed so numerous, and their motion is so rapid, that we can perceive nothing more than average values. Hence, the problems of the mechanical theory of heat are also problems of probability theory.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gilles.montambaux.com/files/histoire-physique/Boltzmann-1872-anglais.pdf&quot;&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann (1872). Further Studies on the Thermal Equilibrium
of Gas Molecules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach was rather avant-garde and weakly received by contemporary scientists. However, Planck, while working on black-body radiation (the radiation responsible for the red color of hot bodies), needed a fundamental explanation for the equation he developed by fitting experimental data. And there he realized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the entropy is an additive magnitude but the probability W is a multiplicative one, I simply postulated that S = k log W where k is a universal constant.

It turns out that &quot;&gt;ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Expected &amp;#039;}&amp;#039;, got &amp;#039;EOF&amp;#039; at end of input: …turns out that &lt;/span&gt;&#92;log(S_1S_2) = &#92;log(S_1) + &#92;log(S_2)$ and so the logarithm was the perfect candidate to keep entropy an ‘additive magnitude.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boltzmann’s constant&lt;/strong&gt; (actually created by Planck) is the last piece of the puzzle. The problem here is that the original formulation of entropy from thermodynamics is measured as &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;/&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;K&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;J/K&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.09618em;&quot;&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07153em;&quot;&gt;K&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Joule over Kelvin), it being a measure of the relationship between heat exchange (Joule) at a given temperature (Kelvin). So Planck introduced &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03148em;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;

that represents the ratio between the amount of substance and the number of particles that it contains. So &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;k&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;k&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03148em;&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was constructed as the &lt;strong&gt;proportionality factor that relates thermal energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of such gas&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summing up, Boltzmann and Planck wrote a definition of entropy that is a measure of how much we can infer about the arrangement of a system on the basis of its distribution. The original definition of entropy can be derived from this one, assuming an ideal gas (non-interacting particles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leap from the first definition of entropy is abysmal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probabilities and information enter the picture. We now quantify entropy given how much we do not know of the inner working of a system, given its outer properties. What’s inner and outer? It depends on what we are interested in. Perspective counts. &lt;strong&gt;Entropy depends on what the observer wants to know about the system and what she already knows&lt;/strong&gt;. If ‘observer’ rings some quantum bells, that’s no surprise. Planck identified energy quantization (the existence of a smallest unit of energy that can be transferred or exchanged) as a prerequisite for this entropy definition so creating the whole field of quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entropy increase is now linked to uniformity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dpaletti.com/assets/posts/entropy_increasing-modified.png&quot; alt=&quot;increasing entropy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the macrostate counts how many particles are on the right and how many on the left. In the low entropy case, there is just one compatible arrangement for a full count on the right, all particles on that side. In the second case, the number of possible arrangements compatible grows as the number of particles on the left grows because we can count the possible compatible arrangements as:&lt;/p&gt;

Now, one very important consideration. Some say that in this picture disorder grows from right to left. It does not seem so obvious to me. I would rather say that the middle picture appears more disordered. Disorder is not really a formally defined term but rather a personal perception on the state of things, &lt;strong&gt;using disorder when talking about entropy can be highly misleading&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, and that’s the norm, we can clearly see that the last state reached is an equilibrium one in which the entropy is maximized and nothing more can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;entropy has a maximum&lt;/strong&gt;? Maybe, from this construction, it seems rather obvious that as thermodynamic processes march along, they tend to move towards the microstate that maximizes the number of arrangements with respect to the macrostate. This tendency is simply derived from the fact that these microstates outnumber  all the others and so assuming random movement, there will be convergence there sooner or later. Extending this idea to the whole universe we introduce &lt;strong&gt;Heat death&lt;/strong&gt;. This hypothesis states that the universe will reach maximum entropy, and a state of complete equilibrium will cease all thermodynamic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have seen, the Boltzmann-Planck formulation introduces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;probabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: processes become statistical, probability theory is the new language of entropy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt;: entropy quantifies how much knowledge we can infer about a system, heat is out of the picture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;observer&lt;/strong&gt;: coarse-graining implies that an observer may choose any macrostate given what she knows about the system and what she wants to know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entropy picture changed drastically, broadening the applicability of the concept and increasing the potential pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boltzmann derived many formulations for entropy, following several different paths. Here we summarized the most famous one. Throughout this article, we always take into account entropy formulations that have the highest chance of being mentioned in the general discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here things start to get a bit notation heavy but conceptually we are not moving that far, I promise.
Earlier we said &lt;strong&gt;probability is the new language of entropy&lt;/strong&gt; but no probabilities were on sight, here probability densities &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ρ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;rho&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;ρ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; take center stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbs set out to change the object of study of entropy from an individual system to an ensemble. Also said, we are moving from a theory of gases to a theory of systems. The ensemble is an uncountably infinite collection of independent systems that are all governed by the same equations but whose state at time &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;t&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6151em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this definition cannot be used to describe an approach to equilibrium in terms of entropy increase due to the Hamiltonian System assumption (underlying everything we said about Gibbs entropy) and Liouville’s Theorem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbs proposed the previous definition of entropy in ‘Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics’ where towards the end he identified a solution to the equilibrium problem: &lt;strong&gt;coarse-graining&lt;/strong&gt;. In this formalism the idea is to take a partition &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ω&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;omega&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03588em;&quot;&gt;ω&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;γ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;X_&#92;gamma&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.9694em;vertical-align:-0.2861em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07847em;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.1514em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0785em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05556em;&quot;&gt;γ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.2861em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where we get a set of cells &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ω&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;omega_i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03588em;&quot;&gt;ω&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.3117em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0359em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of equal volume &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;δ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ω&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;delta &#92;omega&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03785em;&quot;&gt;δ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.03588em;&quot;&gt;ω&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

Jaynes’s interpreted &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;ρ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;(&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;γ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo separator=&quot;true&quot;&gt;,&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo stretchy=&quot;false&quot;&gt;)&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;rho(x_&#92;gamma, t)&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:1.0361em;vertical-align:-0.2861em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;ρ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mopen&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.1514em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05556em;&quot;&gt;γ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.2861em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mpunct&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.1667em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mclose&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as our lack of knowlege about a microstate of a system given its macro condition. &lt;strong&gt;Entropy becomes a measure of how much knowledge we lack&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, knowledge, perspective, and stochasticity. This entropy definition consolidated all those concepts that were already imbued in Boltzmann’s definition through a more explicit and general formalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have talked so much about knowledge that is now time to focus on information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this is surprisingly similar to Gibbs’. We move from densities to discrete probabilities but this is to be expected when moving from the continuous to the discrete. This looks very much like a discretization of the previous one without the Boltzmann constant. So, what’s the role of this definition almost 50 years after the ones from Gibbs and Planck? Formalizing a theory of communication for noisy channels and compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shannon was thinking about this &lt;strong&gt;problem&lt;/strong&gt;: there is a source &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;S&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;S&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05764em;&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; producing messages which are communicated to a receiver &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;R&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;R&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.00773em;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; registering them.

Why does a uniformly distributed process takes more bits to be communicated? The intuition is that, a nonuniform coin always admits some tricks (compression we would say). In this case we use 1 bit to say whether both coins output was head, and this would happen very often 0.9*0.9=0.81=81% of the times. In the other cases we would fallback to using two bits to encode the outcome of both coins. Being this a probabilistic measure we can go lower than 1 bit, in a real communication this is obviously not possible but an interesting theoretical result to create efficient compression strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is a measure of information content, why is this called entropy? Von Neumann is the culprit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esalq.usp.br/lepse/imgs/conteudo_thumb/Energy-and-Information.pdf&quot;&gt;McIrvine, Edward C. and Tribus, Myron (1971). Energy and Information Scientific American 225&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Neumann, who at the time was working on entropy himself, observed that Shannon’s formulation is very similar to already existing formulations in statistical mechanics. Discrete versions of Gibbs entropy and probabilistic versions of Boltzmann entropy had already been discussed in statistical mechanics by 1948.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables have turned again, &lt;strong&gt;entropy can now be used to characterize any (discrete) stochastic process&lt;/strong&gt;. Later works also extended Shannon entropy to the continuous case, as in the case of Renyi which was able to derive the continuous case reaching a formulation equal to Gibbs’ except for the multiplicative constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entropy lost its measurement units&lt;/strong&gt; definitely escaping the thermodynamics world so characterizing processes of any kind. The discrete case does not even need coarse-graining, even if this is more related to the discrete nature of the process rather than a theoretical evolution, in the continuous case we would still need to deal with coarse graining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real revolution of Shannon formulation is &lt;strong&gt;linking thermodynamics and information&lt;/strong&gt;. This led Jaynes (1957) to reconceptualize statistical mechanics through the lens of information theory. His work culminated in the &lt;strong&gt;maximum entropy principle&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge about a system is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf&quot;&gt;E.T. Jaynes (1957). Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also said, we should always choose the distribution that is maximally noncommittal with respect to the missing information because by not doing so we would make assertions for which we have no evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Shannon’s work we are able to apply entropy to almost any process. The interpretation is the same we have given for Gibbs’ entropy. &lt;strong&gt;Entropy remains a measure of what we do not know about a system given what we know and what we want to know&lt;/strong&gt;. We are still talking about uncertainty, perspective, and stochasticity. The maximum entropy distribution is the uniform, which I would not call the most disordered distribution of all. So still, talking about disorder seems at best misleading at worst completely wrong. Uncertainty on the other hand keeps being the best overarching interpretation we can give, sidestepping Clausius’ definition where uncertainty does not play any role and instead we would be better talking about non-idealities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information theory is a very generally applicable field and so Shannon’s definition not only built a bridge to statistical mechanics but it also gave rise to many new entropy definitions which can be to different degrees matched to Shannon’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sample twice from the same random variable and in both case you get an outcome with probability &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, this event has a probability &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;p&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;p^2&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:1.0085em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8141em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mtight&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of occurring. This is why we can interpret it as a collision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we go towards infinity the entropy is increasingly determined by the events of highest probability. In the limit &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;α&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;→&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;&gt;∞&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;alpha &#92;rightarrow &#92;infty&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.0037em;&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;∞&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the Renyi entropy converges to &lt;strong&gt;min-entropy&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the most conservative way of measuring the unpredictability of a set of outcomes, &lt;strong&gt;the negative logarithm of the probability of the most likely outcome&lt;/strong&gt;. It is the smallest entropy measure in the family of Renyi entropies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entropy has numerous application in all those cases in which we need a strong guarantee on the information content of a discrete random variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, Renyi entropy can also be employed at different &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;α&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;alpha&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.0037em;&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; levels than the ones I showed here. The idea stays the same, take Shannon’s definition and bend it to accomodate different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a set of possible system states &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;∈&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;x &#92;in X&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;∈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07847em;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this is the phase space of the system. Take now a family of deterministic transformations &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;T&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;mo&gt;:&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;→&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;T_t: X &#92;rightarrow X&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.13889em;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.2806em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.1389em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07847em;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mrel&quot;&gt;→&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mspace&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.2778em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07847em;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mapping the phase space to itself with &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;t&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;t&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6151em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; being the time. Think a cart on a rail which given some initial position and velocity is left free to run around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entropy definition takes into account &lt;strong&gt;volume preserving dynamical systems&lt;/strong&gt; which are (loosely speaking) systems that admit a metric &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;mu&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over the phase space which is preserved through system evolution. We take into account all the systems whose state space admits some definition of a distance so we can measure lengths, areas, volumes, and these measurements do not get distorted through transformation (many systems fit in this category). Ok then, what’s the connection between this and what we were discussing earlier? &lt;strong&gt;Probabilities&lt;/strong&gt;.
The measures &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;mu&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we are talking about are normalized to sum to one so that we can apply probability theory to them. To get back to the cart again, we know that this cart may be in any position along the rail and could have any speed at each position. The measure &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;mu&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; we are talking about is reasoning about joint intervals of position and velocities to understand how much of the whole cart phase space they occupy. Also said, how likely it is for the cart to be in a given position with a given velocity. ‘Likely’ is the keyword here. The probability of an event &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05764em;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the fraction of time the system spends in the region of &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;X&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07847em;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; associated with &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05764em;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (assuming the system is ergodic).
&lt;strong&gt;The observer chooses the event she wants to monitor (the macrostate) the microstate evolves according to some underlying transformation and we build a measure of how likely it is for the system to produce the event we are interested in&lt;/strong&gt;.
To the cart again. Let’s add a sensor on top of the rail which triggers every time the cart passes in front of it with a speed lower than a given limit. The event &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;E&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.05764em;&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the sensor triggering. The region of the space &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;X&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;X&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.6833em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.07847em;&quot;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the subspace with the positions in front of the sensors joined with the admissible speeds. &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;mu&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the area of the rectangle built joining the two intervals, position along the rail and cart speed, and then divided (i.e. normalized) for the area of the rectangle made of total speed range and total rail length. So this is &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;μ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;mu&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;μ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a probability in disguise but with a more flexible interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus on &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;α&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;alpha&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.0037em;&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; now.
&lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;α&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;alpha&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.0037em;&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a partition of our measure preserving system. A partition is some kind of subdivision of our phase space that covers the whole space and does not have any overlap (e.g. a grid superimposed on our space where the cells are not necessarily all equal). Sounds familiar? coarse-graining! But that’s not all, &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;α&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;alpha&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.0037em;&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;makes encoding explicit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we have discussed earlier, in Shannon’s equation the number of bits takes into account the best encoding possible, like in the weighted coin case. When the distribution is not uniform there is always some clever encoding that allows me to reduce the number of bits with respect to the maximum I would need to communicate the uniform case. This kind of considerations become explicit through the encoding &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;mi&gt;α&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;&#92;alpha&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.4306em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:0.0037em;&quot;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;⁡. &lt;strong&gt;We relate partitions and encodings through messages&lt;/strong&gt;. Every time the trajectory passes through the i-th ‘cell’ of the partition we save a message &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;m&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;m_i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.3117em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; registering so to build a description of the trajectory not through the phase space but through the ‘partition-space’. Take the cart again (I promise it’s almost over), partitioning its phase space would equal to partitioning the rail in sections and creating speed intervals. We would produce a message &lt;span class=&quot;katex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-mathml&quot;&gt;&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;semantics&gt;&lt;mrow&gt;&lt;msub&gt;&lt;mi&gt;m&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;i&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/msub&gt;&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;annotation encoding=&quot;application/x-tex&quot;&gt;m_i&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/semantics&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;katex-html&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;base&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;strut&quot; style=&quot;height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal&quot;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;msupsub&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-t vlist-t2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.3117em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pstrut&quot; style=&quot;height:2.7em;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mord mathnormal mtight&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-s&quot;&gt;​&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist-r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vlist&quot; style=&quot;height:0.15em;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; every time the cart passes through a given rail section with a speed in a given speed interval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which &lt;strong&gt;measures the highest average amount of information that the system can produce per step relative to an encoding&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entropy is now alive. This result is relevant because we now talk about information/entropy production through time. That’s the first definition we encounter in which system evolution is so apparent. Maybe Clausius original definition would be the closer in this regard with the integral representing an actual transformation through time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A positive KS entropy is often linked to chaos&lt;/strong&gt;. Shannon information measures uncertainty and uncertainty is a form of unpredictability. A positive KS entropy means that the behaviour of the system is unpredictable. Disorder takes the stage again. I have been going on and on about disorder not being representative of any entropy definition and now a link to chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

Does this seem disordered? I would not say so, maybe someone would. It is important to note that &lt;strong&gt;chaos can be summarized through Lorenz words&lt;/strong&gt; as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not necessarily a definition of disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from this nitpick, we made a spectacular leap. Sinai and Kolmogorov through their work connected information theory and dynamical systems theory. We now have an entropy definition to quantify entropy production rate, that is the behavior of a whole system. Until now we have been characterizing states while now we have a new layer of abstraction on top, systems can now have an entropy regardless of their initial state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Clausius all the way to Kolmogorov. We started with a definition of entropy that would not accommodate much of what we frequently say when talking about entropy. Then we found the culprit, after Boltzmann work entropy becomes a quantification of uncertainty for a given observer with a given interest in the system under scrutiny. Then, Gibbs paved the way and Shannon freed entropy from thermodynamics to make it a universal quantity. Renyi generalized Shannon’s work retaining the theoretical framework but greatly increasing the applicability. Finally, Kolmogorov and Sinai extended entropy to dynamical systems theory moving from a fixed value to entropy production rate useful for directing entropy to systems rather than transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Boltzmann lens the most actionable definition of entropy si &lt;strong&gt;entropy as uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;: how much we do not know about a system given what we already know and what we want to know. Entropy is linked to the observer and the interest she has in the system under scrutiny. Stochasticity introduces uncertainty about a system and we can use entropy to quantify how hard is to get more information to fill the knowledge gaps we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more work has been done on entropy in quantum physics and cosmology for example. I think that these works have not yet entered the pop discourse (maybe for the lack of consensus) so I decided not to take them into account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Beyond Conway&#39;s law: bridging structure and function&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this article I will examine organizations: &lt;strong&gt;systems designing other systems&lt;/strong&gt;. What structural qualities are prevalent when predicting an organization’s function? That is, what structural qualities allow an organization to build effective systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;conway’s law&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.melconway.com/Home/pdf/committees.pdf&quot;&gt;Mel Conway - How do Committees Invent?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway models an &lt;strong&gt;organization as a graph&lt;/strong&gt;, with edges representing communication channels and vertices representing teams, where a team may also represent a single individual.
In the original paper, &lt;strong&gt;system design&lt;/strong&gt; is discussed as the intellectual activity which creates a useful whole from its diverse parts. A system always implies a factorization; a factorization implies an amalgamation. Both these processes happen at the two ends of the design process. If designing means identifying and solving sub-problems then it also means merging subsolutions into the final artifact. Once we fix a design team, there is a &lt;strong&gt;class of design alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; that cannot be effectively pursued by such an organization because the necessary &lt;strong&gt;communication paths&lt;/strong&gt; do not exist. Organizing means biasing the design team towards a specific solution set.
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conway makes this even clearer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://melconway.com/Home/pdf/simplify.pdf&quot;&gt;Toward Simplifying Application Development, in a Dozen Lessons&lt;/a&gt; where he stresses that if you want the cleanest possible solution you have to find the simplest possible design before organizing to build, or else you have to be prepared to &lt;strong&gt;reorganize&lt;/strong&gt;. Be prepared to scramble.
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mapping between structure and function must be interpreted as bidirectional, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism&quot;&gt;homomorphic&lt;/a&gt;. Skelton and Pais (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://res.infoq.com/articles/book-review-team-topologies/en/resources/TTOP_excerpt_InfoQ-1572531146315.pdf&quot;&gt;Team Topology&lt;/a&gt;) call Conway’s law a &lt;strong&gt;homomorphic force&lt;/strong&gt;. Figure this rope connecting producer and product that keeps them tight by not stretching too far. Structural changes must happen on both sides, else they won’t happen even if we are induced to think otherwise.
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homomorphic force keeps organization and design tight through time. When working on an existing (not necessarily legacy) system its structure reflects all the organization structure variations through time, that is every organization that altered the system in some way. Casey Muratori calls this phenomenon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUj1EZwpJY&amp;amp;t=697s&quot;&gt;Conway’s nightmare&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;delegation traveling through time&lt;/strong&gt;. Each subsystem is delegated to at least one team, and such delegations may change in the face of changing requirements or new available information. All pre-existing structures affect the current system and must be accounted for. It is as if the structure does not fit on a sheet of paper anymore (if it ever did) but travels in space. We now move from a simple organizational chart to a view of the &lt;strong&gt;evolution of the chart&lt;/strong&gt; through time.
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a system is frequently harder than building it, and that’s no news. However, by looking at a system through the spectacles of the organization’s communication structure through time we may be able to &lt;strong&gt;unveil crucial system aspects before delving into design specifics&lt;/strong&gt; or implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
