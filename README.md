# My Personal Website
[dpaletti.com](https://www.dpaletti.com)
 
This **website works without JS**.

Everything has been developed from scratch with **CSS and HTML**. There's a tiny bit of JQuery in the [header.njk](_includes/header.njk) template to color links on hovering with cycling colors consistently. If JS is disabled this feature does not work.

**11ty** has later been added for removing boilerplate and speedup development.
